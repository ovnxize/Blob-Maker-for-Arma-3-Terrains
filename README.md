# Blob Maker for Arma 3 Terrains

To be honest you can use this for whatever you need, I'm just using it for the satellite mask for Arma 3 terrains to make life easier for me and other terrain makers.

This script has the following dependencies.

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
